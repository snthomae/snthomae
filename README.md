- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name ist Sebastian and I am interested in projects where I can help but also get insights about new technologies and concepts.
- I am experienced in 
-  C#.NET (FW 5.0+) (Expert)
-  C++ (Advanced)
-  Angular / TypeScript (Advanced)
-  Java (Advanced)
-  Golang (Beginner)
I love to write understandable, sustainable (clean) code which is well tested - and in pair programming style ;-).
