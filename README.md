Hi ðŸ‘‹ , 

my name ist Sebastian and I am interested in open source projects where I can help but also get insights about new technologies and concepts.
I am experienced in 
-  C#.NET (Expert)
-  C++ (Advanced)
-  Angular / TypeScript (Advanced)
-  Java (Advanced)
-  Golang (Beginner)

I love to write code in understandable, sustainable and clean manner which is well tested - and I love pair programming ;-).
If you need help for your open source project or just want to discuss ideas and concepts, don't hesitate to contact me.
